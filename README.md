# Astraea-L-Audit: EU AI Act Compliance Engine (Art. 15)

Astraea is an enterprise-grade **Adversarial Audit Framework** specifically designed for 2026 EU AI Act compliance. It detects **Model Poisoning** and **Backdoor Triggers** in LLM/RAG pipelines by monitoring latent activation spikes.

## 🚀 The Solution
High-risk AI systems (Fintech, Health, Infra) must prove resilience against unauthorized tampering (Art. 15.4). Astraea hooks into the neural layers of models (Llama 3, Mistral) to identify statistical anomalies in inference behavior that standard firewalls miss.

## 🛠 Technical Features
- **Neural Layer Hooking:** Real-time monitoring of residual stream activations.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Z-score calculation against clean-prompt baselines.
- **Compliance Reporting:** Automated PDF generation mapping results to specific AI Act clauses.
- **Cloud-Native:** Built for RunPod Serverless GPU architecture.

## 💼 Commercial Offer
I provide high-fidelity **AI Security Audits** starting at €15,000 per engagement.
- 48-hour vulnerability mapping.
- Formal EU AI Act Conformity Assessment.
- Remediation Roadmap for RAG integrity.
